OUTSTANDING ISSUES

-NESTED PARAMETERS NOT PERMITTING AND INCLUDING FOR QUERY WITH USER. MANUALLY PUNCHING IT IN IN USERS CONTROLLER

-USER NEEDS TO ACCESS THEIR OWN PAGE AND SEE LIST OF QUERIES, CLICKING EACH QUERY SHOULD SHOW CHECK HISTORY. CRUDDY.

-AFTER THIS IS IMPLEMENTED, USER AUTH NEEDS TO HAPPEN. EMAIL ACCOUNT CONFIRMATION AND ACCOUNT SET UP AFTER REGISTER FOR ALERT. PHASE TWO.
