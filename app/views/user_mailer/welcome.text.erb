What happens next?

Every day our application will scan the State of Montana's API; and if the State has registered a check written to |||THIS WILL HOUSE | current_user.queries[0].content ||||, we will send you an email with the details of the check and a link to the Payee's history of receiving checks from the state. It's that simple!
his email was sent to <%= @user.email %>. Not <%= @user.email %>? Click here to report or unsubscribe.
