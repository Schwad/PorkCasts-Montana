# Changes in 2.0

* Users now in has and belongs to many relationships with query
* Ruby updated to 2.3.3
* Briefly disabled breaking elements due to removed state of MT API
* Removes old 'shared' pathway and convoluted logic, allows anyone direct access to query with id such as `/queries/:id`
* creates paths for public searching and query acquisition for user from new search path
* Implements complete 'private search' path. This allows users to search and view without logging in.
* Query index load time cut 50% with eager loading of checks and credit cards for counts
* Implemented searchkick along with elasticsearch, initially for payee name but leaving open for loads of amazing customisation. SUPER fast.
* dumped all legacy views and controllers into v1 path, which is now deprecated and will not receive further support. (consider it nostalgia that I didn't want to kill my old designs.)
